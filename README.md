## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  
  This project required that we write a type of maze game that utilizes a Q-learning artificial intelligence algorithm to help the actor navigate through 
  a maze. We were provided almost all of the code except for the Q-learning implementation section. Essentially, the algorithm described what the actor 
  would be doing at every action taken in the game. Every move performed involved that the actor consider its environment and assign a reward value to the 
  different actions available to it such as which direction it could move: up down, left or right. 

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

  ### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
	
  ### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
	
  ### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
	
  
  Computer scientists use or increase our knowledge in computer science principle which can be used to further develope our technology the more we know. 
  Our devices get smarter, faster, powerful, complex and capable. The technological discoveries obtained thanks to computer science can then be appllied to 
  other industries which only further developes society as a whole. To approach a problem as a computer scientist, one must first thoroughly understand the 
  problem, break it down into managable pieces and solve it from there. As powerful as the technology we have today are, they can easily be used to exploit 
  or harm the people it serves. It is the responsabilities of those who use computer science in any way to ensure that people are not harmed from it. For 
  exmaple, this could be reporting the people ordering the misuse of artificial intelligence for unethical gains to the proper authorities.
